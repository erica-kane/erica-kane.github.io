### [Planning for Drunks](https://github.com/erica-kane/CPSA2)


This project involves a model which simulates the movements of drunks on their way home from a pub, and plots their paths. 

The model will: 

- Read in an town plan
- Derive coordinate points for the buildings (houses and a pub) in the plan
- Initialise buildings using these points
- Initialise drunks attributable to a house
- Move drunks from the pub to their home
- Save, plot, and write out a csv file of these movements 


**Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/erica-kane/CPSA2/blob/main/README.md) file before attempting to run the model.**
