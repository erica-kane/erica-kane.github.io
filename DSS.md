## Predicting Social Trust

[View repository](https://github.com/erica-kane/Data-Science-Studio)

This project uses data from the European Social Survey round 9 to attempt to predict social trust. Firstly, the data is explored to look at relationships between some key variables (such as country, gender, and age) and social trust. There is then a unsupervised learning section in which the data is clustered into four clusters by k-means, and the characterisation of each cluster is observed. This section uses the following variables: 

- Social trust
- Position on left-right political scale
- Legal trust 
- Happiness 
- Religious commitment 
- Parliamentary trust 

In the supervised learning section predictions of trust are derived from regression and random forest models and the results are cross-validated to reveal signs of overfitting. 

All code, results, and output are available in the [HTML](https://github.com/erica-kane/Data-Science-Studio/blob/main/computational_essay.html) linked in the repository.
