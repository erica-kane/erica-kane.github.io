## PhD Project 

### Background

The Parole Board currently have over 16,000 decision letters, each relating to a hearing conducted to decide whether or not a prisoner is an appropraite
 candidate to be granted parole. The letters contain information regarding the defendent, crime, behaviour, conditions, and the decision. These letters are currently in natural language format so have not been explored on a large-scale basis to discover patterns in the parole process.

### My Role

The Parole Board will send me copies of these letters with the goal of producing a large tabular dataset containing relevant case information which can be used for statistical analysis. To do this, I will first have to anonymise the data then extract the desired information. Both these stages will require Natural Language Processing techniques. The content and structure of the letters will dictate which methods are used.
The resulting dataset will then be analysed, investigating for patterns of ethnic and racial disparaties in the decision making process. Supplementary analysis will depend on what information can be derived from the letters. The data will then become available to other researchers for further analysis on different elements of the parole process.
