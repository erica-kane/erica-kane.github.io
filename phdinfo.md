## PhD Project 

### Background

The Parole Board currently have over 16,000 decision letters, each relating to a hearing conducted to decide whether or not a prisoner is an appropriate candidate to be granted parole. The letters contain information regarding the defendant, crime, behaviour, conditions, and the decision. These letters are currently in natural language format so have not been explored on a large-scale basis to discover patterns in the parole process.

### My Role

The Parole Board will send me copies of these letters with the goal of producing a large tabular dataset containing relevant case information which can be used for statistical analysis. To do this, I will first have to anonymise the data then extract the desired information. Both these stages will require Natural Language Processing techniques. The content and structure of the letters will dictate which methods are used.
The resulting dataset will then be analysed, investigating for patterns of ethnic and racial disparities in the decision-making process. Supplementary analysis will depend on what information can be derived from the letters. The data will then become available to other researchers for further analysis on different elements of the parole process. 

### Developments 

So far, steps that have been taken in the project include:

- An updated research proposal has been developed 
- Parole hearings attended 
- A small study on the role of victims in decision-making has been conducted 
- Data management plans have been drawn up 
- A small amount of test code has been written on two example decision letters 

### Next Steps

Due to the high sensitivity of the data the transfer process is still ongoing. Within the next six months I hope to have received  the data to begin familiarising myself with it. The next step after this will be the anonymisation process which will be conducted in a [LASER](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/about-lida/integrated-research-campus/) secure lab. During this period I also intend to spend some time with the Parole Board in person to learn more about the structure and procedures of the organisation themselves.
