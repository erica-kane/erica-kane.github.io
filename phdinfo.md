## PhD Project 

### Background

The Parole Board currently have over 16,000 decision letters relating to hearings conducted to decide whether or not a prisoner is an appropraite
 candidate to be granted parole. The letters contain information regarding the defendent, crime, behaviour, conditions, and the decision. 

### My Role

I will be working with the Parole Board to quantify these letters using Natural Language Processing techniques. This will create the first large scale statistical
data set relating to Parole decisions in the UK. The results will then be analysed, investigating the data for patterns of ethnic disparaties in the decision making
process. Supplementary analysis will depend on what information can be derived from the letters.
