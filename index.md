# About Me

My name is Erica McGovern and I am from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I recently graduated from a Criminology undergraduate course at the University of Leeds, where I currently study as a first year MSc/PhD student. I am a beginner programmer, with experience in basic R and Python.

Please enjoy my first ever Python project, consisting of two agent based models which create and move agents inside an environment.
