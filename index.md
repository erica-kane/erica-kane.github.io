# About Me

My name is Erica McGovern and I am from Belfast, Northern Ireland. I recently graduated from a Criminology undergraduate course at the University of Leeds, where I currently study as a first year MSc/PhD student. I am a beginner programmer, with experience in basic R and Python.

Please enjoy my first ever Python project, consisting of two agent based models which create and move agents inside an environment. 


# Projects

[ABM Practical](https://github.com/ericamcg/ABMpractical)

This project involves two models, a base model and an enhancement 

The base model: 

- Reads in an environment
- Scrapes web data used to initialise agents 
- Initialises agents which move, eat (from the environment), and share (with each other) 
- Randomly moves the agents on an animated GUI plot 
- Prints their total store (amount eaten) to a file 


The enhanced model:

- Reads in an environment 
- Initialises Sheep which eat, move, and die 
- Initialises Preds which hunt
- Plots behaviours on an animated matplotlib scatter graph



**Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/ericamcg/ABMpractical/blob/master/README.md) file before attempting to run the model.**
