## Rossman pharmaceutical sales 

[View repository](https://github.com/erica-kane/UDATEReport)

The aim of this project is to select and create variables relating to Rossman pharmacies which have a relationship with sales. This project uses two datasets:

- Sales of pharmacies 
- Details of the pharmacy store (promotions, competition, assortment)

The two datasets are linked, and then I created useful variables from those provided in the original data, for example 
 - Month and year from date
 - Days since nearest competitor opened 
 - How long promotions have been running 
 - How long it has been since coupons were sent out for promotions 

The realtionships between all variables and sales were observed, before creating a final dataset and building a predictive random forest model.

The [reportscript.py](https://github.com/erica-kane/UDATEReport/blob/master/reportscript.py) file shows the code which was developed for the analysis.
